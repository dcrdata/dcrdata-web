# dcrdata-web

This is a Vue.js based front end to [dcrdata](https://github.com/decred/dcrdata).

A build of latest master is deployed at https://dcr-data.netlify.com/#/

## Build Setup

If you plan to run this locally, you'll want to follow the setup steps in the dcrdata repo to setup the localhost api.

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev

# build for production with minification
npm run build

# build for production and view the bundle analyzer report
npm run build --report
```
